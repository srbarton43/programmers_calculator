# Programmer's Calculator

A work in progress!

## The Plan

A quick and simple CLI calculator for bit operations, inspired by lots of bit operations in my computer architecture course.
The biggest feature which I want to add which I have not found in other programming calculators is the ability for specifying different word-sizes: ie, 16-bit vs 32-bit vs 64-bit.

## Current Progress........

- Have a struct to represent numbers but don't love it
- Building the tokenizer and the parser (will use Shunting Yard Algorithm most likely).

## TODO

- Incorporate flex lexer and bison parser for the CLI parsing
- figure out how to do testing inside of CMAKE instead of using other Makefiles
